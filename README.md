# Tailverse

Welcome to the Tailverse! This repository houses a collection of various tools and utilities related to Tailwind CSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework. Whether you're looking to create stylish components, work with gradients, or streamline your development process with Tailwind, this repository has got you covered. Feel free to explore the different tools available and contribute your own!


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Components in Tailwind

In this section, you'll find a collection of pre-built components and UI elements that leverage Tailwind CSS classes. These components can be easily integrated into your projects, saving you time and effort in building user interfaces from scratch.

- **Button Styles**: A variety of button styles with different colors, sizes, and hover effects.
- **Card Components**: Attractive and responsive card components for displaying content.
- **Navbar Templates**: Ready-to-use navigation bar templates for different layouts.
- **Form Elements**: Styled form inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

## Color Gradients

This section contains tools and utilities related to color gradients in Tailwind CSS. Gradients can add a touch of sophistication and depth to your designs, and these tools make it easier to work with them.

- **Gradient Generator**: A user-friendly gradient generator that allows you to customize gradient colors and directions. Copy the generated CSS code directly into your project.

## Tailwind to CSS Translator

Are you more comfortable working with CSS directly? No worries! This section includes a handy translator tool that lets you write code using Tailwind CSS syntax and converts it into standard CSS. This way, you can still benefit from the ease of Tailwind's utility classes while exporting standard CSS code for your project.

## CSS to Tailwind Translator

For those who prefer writing CSS code manually or have existing projects built with standard CSS, this section offers a reverse translator. Simply paste your CSS code into the tool, and it will generate the equivalent Tailwind CSS classes, allowing you to transition your project to use the utility-first approach effortlessly.
